            <h1>HOW IT BEGAN</h1>
            <p class="content-text">In 2011, co-founders Mike Darlington and Ari Paunonen met at the University of Waterloo, connecting over their shared love of music and entrepreneurial spirit. Noticing the steady rise of video platforms like YouTube, as well as the booming electronic music scene at the time, Mike and Ari set out to launch a boundary-pushing digital record label that would deliver high-quality, accessible electronic music. With community at the core, they built a tight-knit family of passionate artists, global music fans, avid gamers, and content creators, that came to be known as Monstercat.</p>
